  comprehensible Java classes.

- BerInteger is now based on BigInteger instead of long. Thus it can
  code integer values larger than 8 bytes.

  same name as the SEQUENCE OF type, e.g. SEQUENCE { test SEQUENCE OF
  Test }

  which can be used inside the ASN.1 file in order to generate Java
  code that will not decod nor encode elements of these types.
